Space is not empty. It is full of possibilities.

When you dance Improtango, you don’t just move in space – you shape it. You explore different directions. You find spatial relationships. You play with height, distance, proximity.

Space is transformative, dynamic. It is part of the dance, not just its surroundings.

Your interaction with the space gives your dance depth and dimension. It makes it a three-dimensional, living experience.

Space invites you to explore. Who knows what you will find when you dare to take a new direction?
