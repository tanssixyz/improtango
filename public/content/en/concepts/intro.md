# Basic concepts of Improtango

> We should consider every day lost that we have not danced at least once.

Seven basic concepts form the heart of Improtango. They are not rules but keys – ways to understand what happens when two people create dance together, in the moment.

Each concept opens the door to deeper understanding. Together, they create a framework for a dance in which both can influence, create and discover something truly new.
