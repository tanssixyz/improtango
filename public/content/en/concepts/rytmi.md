Rhythm is not just in the music. It is in you.

It is the building and releasing of tension. The shifting of weight. The breathing. The meeting of two peopleâ€™s pulses.

When you dance together, you create ever-changing tensions. You build. You release. This creates drama, intensity of feeling, life.

Rhythm also arises from the transition from individual balance to collective balance. Together you find a rhythm where individuality merges with unity.

This shared pulse deepens the connection. It creates trust. It moves the dance forward.
