Two different energies meet.

One moves, the other stands still. One seeks freedom, the other structure. These opposites do not fight each other â€“ they dance.

It is from this tension that movement is born. When opposites harmonize, dance comes to life. It is not steady or predictable. It is a dynamic, living entity.

In impro tango, the dialogue between structure and chaos holds the dance together. Structure provides the framework for creativity to flourish. Without this opposition, dance would be just movement.
