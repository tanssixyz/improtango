The body speaks.

It transmits impulses through touch. Subtle shifts of weight, tension, release. All of this is communication – nonverbal messages that your partner reads in their body.

Your body needs to be adaptable. Sensitive. Responsive.

You can’t think too much. You can’t try to control. You need to listen – both to your own body and to your partner.

When you find a balance between your body and your partner, when you maintain a harmonious connection, something beautiful is born. A dialogue that happens through body language.
