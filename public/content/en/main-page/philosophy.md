# Real dialogue

Improtango starts with simple improvisational exercises. No complicated step sequences. No leader and follower in the traditional sense.

Instead: clear, intuitive communication. A real dialogue, where both have an equally influential voice.

You can dance simply, based on a few principles. Or build a multi-level, challenging dance with a partner. You and your partner decide.
