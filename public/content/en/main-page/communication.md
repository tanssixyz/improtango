# Something extraordinary

As contemporary dance choreographers, we had been working for years on pairing and improvisation. Tango brought something we had never experienced before: the opportunity for deep communication in the moment of dance.

We were fascinated by the way two dancers merge and create something unique – right in that moment.

But what was frustrating was how tango is most often taught: ready-made step sequences, choreographed movement by the teacher.

We wanted something different. We wanted to create a dance form where deep communication is present from the very beginning. In every practice. In every moment.

## Improvisation first

Improve tango was born from where the magic of tango really happens: improvisation.

Instead of learning ready-made combinations, we break down the basic elements of tango into parts. We practice them separately. We gradually implement them. We build towards more complex structures – at our own pace.

This approach opens up the inner world of tango. It encourages freedom and creativity.

Improtango is a bridge between the traditional and the modern. It combines the communication and structure of tango with a modern understanding of roles, expression and musical interpretation.

## Unpredictable

When two dancers trust their instincts and are fully present, something special happens.

Anticipation disappears. Expectations disappear. What remains is listening – a genuine, bodily dialogue.

Every step is unpredictable. Every moment is an opportunity to discover something new. Together.

## A delicate balance

The journey of improtango has been a balancing act for us: structure and creativity, technique and interpretation, tradition and innovation.

It is a social dance. It is a choreographic language. It is constantly deepening and evolving.

Improtango has opened up new perspectives for us – both in dance art and social dance.
